# NYBG_Libguides2
This repository includes HTML and CSS used to create a demo LibGuides2 template/layout for a library homepage.
2017/Feb/17

This layout was created as an experiment in modifying a SpringShare LibGuides2 homepage and using it as the library's landing page. Ultimately, the project was not realized as the institution decided to undergo a full revamping of the main website, including a redesign of the library's existing webpage.

The code in these files displays slightly differently than it did when used on the LibGuides platform, as the screencap demonstrates. However, as the project is no longer supported, I have left the code as-is with the thought that others using LibGuides2 may still find my work to be useful.
